# ft_linear_regression
In this project, you will implement your first machine learning algorithm.

## Usage :
'''
python3 train.py ["data.csv"] [-m "model.json"] [-e int] [-b int] [-p]
with :  -m = model json file
        -e = epochs to train
        -b = batch size
        -p = plot
'''

and then,

'''
pyhon3 predict ["model.json"]
'''
